# Laboratory 4 - Procedure

In this lab, you will develop a model of your cantilevered beam using Ansys, and conduct a modal analysis to discover its fundamental 
frequencies and mode shapes. You will be judging the accuracy of your model in three ways:

- Convergence - examining the tendency of the FEA to approach a final solution with decreasing element size
- Verification - comparing your results to an analytical model
- Validation - comparing your results to an experimental model


## Task 0 - Getting started

-  Open Ansys, and familiarize yourself with the interface. Poke around and take a look at different menus
-  There is extensive "Help" documentation available from the top menu bar. It includes "getting started" resources that could be helpful

## Task 1 - Define your physical model

-  Start a new project.
-  To select a modal analysis, drag the "modal" option from the left-hand menu into the project schematic.
-  Right-click on "engineering data" to add materials to your model and edit their properties
-  Right-click on "geometry" and open a new DesignModeler file. Here you can define the geometry of your bar.

## Task 2 - Define your analysis

-  Right-click on "model" to edit
-  Make sure your bar is using the correct material - under "geometry" select your shape and check the bottom-left info pane
-  Add a fixed-support condition to one end of your beam by right-clicking on "modal"
-  Select "mesh" in the left-hand pane. In the info panel, turn off adaptive sizing. Edit the element size to change the number of nodes

## Task 3 - Run your analysis

-  Right-click "solution" and select solve
-  Make a note of the natural frequencies and the number of nodes
-  You may add mode shape visualizations to the model by highlighting them in the table and selecting "Create mode shape results" in the right-click context menu
-  Increase the number of nodes and re-run the solution.
-  You are looking to demonstrate and document convergence of the first three mode shapes.
-  Using a probe, investigate the strain at a location corresponding to you strain gauge.

## Your Report

-  Demonstrate convergence of the first three modes, using the two methods shown in the Background and Resources section.
-  Compare your FEA results to your experimental and analytically predicted results.
