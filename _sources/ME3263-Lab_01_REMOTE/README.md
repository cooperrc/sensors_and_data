 Measurements of precision and accuracy of smartphone accelerometers     



# How can you measure something?
All measurements have traceable standards. There are seven base units in SI - meter (length), second (time), Mole (amount of substance), Ampere (electric current), Kelvin (temperature), Candela (Luminous intensity), and kilogram (mass)[ 1 ]. SI derived units are units of measurement derived from the seven base units. They are either dimensionless or can be expressed as a product of one or more of the base units. Any measurement you make should have some method to check against a reference.

In this lab, we will use different smartphones to measure accelertion due to gravity, g, (m/s 2 ). We will perform student's t-test to examine statistical equivalence of two phone measuremnets, and perform analysis to determine accuracy and precision of the measurements.
