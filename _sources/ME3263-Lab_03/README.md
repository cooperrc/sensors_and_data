### What are natural frequencies

In free vibration (i.e., no external forcing), structural components
oscillate at specified frequencies or combinations of frequencies. Since
these vibrations are unforced, the associated frequencies are referred
to as natural frequencies; it's how the system vibrates if left to
behave on its own. In contrast, driven linear systems vibrate at the
driving frequency. An amplification of the response (called resonance)
occurs when the driving frequency coincides with one of the natural
frequencies. In short, the system is driven at a frequency at which it
likes to vibrate. Large amplitude oscillations are the result. So it is
important to know what the natural frequencies are *a priori* so you can
avoid driving the system into resonance.
