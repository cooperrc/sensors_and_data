# Lab 0 - Statistics and Student's t-test

All experimental measurements are subject to random variation. No two measurements will be exactly the same. This variation can, for example, be caused by:

1. Natural variation in a population
1. Unpredictable fluctuations in experimental conditions
1. Uncertainties inherent to the measurement device or system

In practice, this means that we will always be working with uncertain data. Due to cost or practicallity concerns, we will often be working with _limited samples_ of uncertain data. In these situations, we can use Student's t-test to test hypotheses about our data sets, and we can use t-values to establish confidence intervals for the true mean of our measurements.

In this lab, we will use the two-sample t-test to check for a possible manufacturing error in samples of glass marbles.
