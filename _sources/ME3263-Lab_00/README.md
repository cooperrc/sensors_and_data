# Lab 0 - Statistics and the Student t-test

[https://ugmelab.uconn.edu](https://ugmelab.uconn.edu)

We use statistics to draw conclusions from limited data. No measurement is exact. Every
measurement you make has two types of uncertainties, *systematic* and *random*.
*Systematic* uncertainties come from faults in your assumptions or equipment.  *Random*
uncertainties are associated with unpredictable (or unforeseen at the time) experimental
conditions. These can also be due to simplifications of your model. Here are some examples
for caliper measurements:

In theory, all uncertainies could be accounted for by factoring in all physics
in your readings. In reality, there is a diminishing return on investment
for this practice. So we use some statistical insights to draw conclusions. 

# Getting to the Lab resources

When you first click the link for [https://ugmelab.uconn.edu](https://ugmelab.uconn.edu)
you'll be asked to sign in via Github. Use your netid <abc12345> and password and there
will be a server created for you. In the server, is a folder called `work`. Click the
folder to find the `Lab_00` content. From there, open the `ME3263-lab-00.ipynb` notebook
and complete the exercises and analyze the __Marble Madness__ data.
