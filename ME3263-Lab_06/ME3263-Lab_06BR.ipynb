    "A first order system is a system whose dynamic response can be described by a first order differential equation. There are countless\n",
    "examples of such systems - RC circuits, interest accumulation, population models, emptying rates of fluid tanks - and all of them can be\n",

    "where $\\tau$ is the *time constant* which describes the dynamic behavior of the system, $k$ is the *steady-state gain* which describes\n",
    "the system's steady-state behavior in relation to its input, and $F(t)$ is the forcing function or input disturbance. For a given\n",

    "\n",
    "DC motors are devices which take in a continuous direct current and output rotary motion. In a permanent magnet DC motor, stationary permanent magnets (called stators)\n",
    "surround a coil of wire (called the armature) that is carried by the rotor (the rotating portion of the DC motor) (Figure 1). When a \n",
    "current flows through the armature, a magnetic field is induced according to Ampere's law. The presence of the magnetic field from the stators causes the rotor to \n",
    "turn in response to the magnetic field induced by the armature. To transfer current to the moving rotor, brushes make electrical contact \n",
    "with a piece of the rotor called the commutator. The commutator is wired to regularly flip the direction of the armature current to \n",

    "## Measuring Angular Velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to measure the angular velocity of a rotating shaft. Devices for this purpose are called *tachometers*. Two of the most common send one or more voltage pulses for each revolution of the shaft: optical sensors detect a laser bouncing off a reflective surface, and Hall effect sensors detect a passing magnet. For each of these methods, the pulses must be counted per unit time to obtain a value for RPM or rad/s. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any DC motor can also be used as a generator. When the shaft is spun by an outside force, the armature wire loop moves in the magnetic field of the stators. By Faraday's law of induction, this will generate an electromotive force (i.e., voltage). When using a DC motor in this way, the generated voltage will be proportional to the speed of the rotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore possible to use a DC motor as a tachometer, as we will see in this lab. The output sensor voltage $V_s$ is proportional to the input angular velocity $\\Omega$ by some constant $c$:\n",

    "## The Time Constant and the Response to a Step Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The time constant $\\tau$ is the main descriptive characteristic of a first order system. It describes the system's response to a step input: either the rise time in reponse to a positive step, or the decay time in response to a negative step [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an arbitrary first order system described by Equation 1. For a step input, the forcing function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F(t)=Xu(t)$ $\\quad$ (4a)\n",
    "\n",
    "where $X$ is a constant and $u(t)$ is the Heaviside step function given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u(t) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 \\quad t \\le 0 \\\\ 1 \\quad t > 0 \\end{array} \\right. $ $\\quad$ (4b)\n",
    "\n",
    "The response of the system to this input is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(t) = Y\\left ( 1-e^{\\frac{-t}{\\tau}}\\right )$ $\\quad$ (5)\n",
    "\n",
    "where the steady state response is given by $Y=kX$. $k$ is the steady-state gain of the system and $X$ is the magnitude of the step input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time constant $\\tau$ can be extracted in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 2 displays a normalized plot of the step response for an arbitrary first order system. The point referred to as the \"63.2% response point\" is marked. This is the point at which $t/\\tau = 1$, i.e. $t=\\tau$. At this point the dynamic response has reached 63.2% of its steady-state value:\n",

    "*Figure 2: Step response of a first order system, 63.2% response point*\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining the time at which a system has reached 63.2% of its steady-state response provides a quick estimate of the system's time constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Slope of the Response\n",
    "\n",
    "The time constant of the system can also be identified by calculating the slope of the response, i.e. the derivative of the response with respect to time. Taking the derivative of the response (Equation 5) yields an expression for the slope of the response at any given time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{dy}{dt}=\\frac{Y}{\\tau}e^{\\frac{-t}{\\tau}}$ $\\quad$ (7)\n",
    "\n",
    "This slope can be used to construct a tangent line to the curve at any point in time. As shown in Figure 3, this line will intersect the asymptotic (steady-state) value at $\\tau$ time units after the point at which the tangent line was placed. **This will be true for a tangent line created at any arbitrary point** $t_1$ - it will intersect the steady-state response at time $t_2$, and $t_2-t_1=\\tau$ for all $t_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the normalized response plot (Figures 2 & 3) is representative of _all_ first order systems, and is used here to represent an arbitrary system. To find $\\tau$ via differentiation, it will be simplest to use a standard, un-normalized plot - in our case, that would be angular velocity vs. time.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Figure 3: The slope of the response, intersection with the steady-state value*\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain an estimate of the derivative of an experimental data series, *finite difference* methods are often used. The definition of the derivative of a function $f(x)$ at point $a$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f'(a)=\\lim\\limits_{x \\to a}\\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}$ $\\quad$ (8a)\n",
    "\n",
    "If our data consists of discrete points, as all sample data will, the denominator $x-a$ can only become as small as the sampling period. Figure 4 illustrates the concept - each data point is separated by $h$.\n",

    "![Figure 4](./figure4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 4: Data points separated by sampling period h* [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, considering Equation 8a, we could attempt to approximate the derivative at point $x_j$ by taking the difference between it and its neighbor $x_{j+1}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f'(x_j)\\approx \\frac{f(x_{j+1})-f(x_j)}{h}$ $\\quad$ (8b)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the *forward difference* approximation. The *backward difference* uses $x_{j-1}$ instead, for a slightly different result. However, it can be shown via Taylor series expansion that the *central difference* method provides a more accurate approximation than the other two [3]:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "If the experimental data is noisy or scattered, or if the steady-state value is unknown, it will be difficult to identify the 63.2% response point. Taking the derivative of the response is also prone to problems - numerical differentiation is highly sensitive to variations in data. A more rigorous way to determine the time constant is to perform a linear regression on the data. This is accomplished by rearranging Equation 5 as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$1-\\frac{y(t)}{Y}=e^{\\frac{-t}{\\tau}}$ $\\quad$ (9)\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the natural log of both sides results in an equation that is linear in time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ln \\left [ 1-\\frac{y(t)}{Y} \\right ] =-\\frac{1}{\\tau}t$ $\\quad$ (10)\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering time as the independent variable and the entire left-hand side as the dependent variable, this is a linear relationship that can be used to determine the time constant via linear regression. After the transformation, the data will fall on a straight line (as shown in Figure 5). When the data is treated in this manner, the fitted line is constrained to pass through the origin (since there is only one fitting coefficient) and has a slope equal to the reciprocal of the time constant.\n",

    "An armature controlled DC motor is shown schematically in Figure 6. An input voltage, $e_i$, is provided by an external power supply. The motor possesses an internal resistance, $R$, and an inductance, $L$.  This inductance is a result of the electromagnetic effect created by the armature windings, and has a negligible effect on the time response in most situations. The shaft of the motor and driven components (a flywheel and tachometer in the present lab) have an inherent rotational inertia, $J$.  The system also experiences viscous damping, characterized by the coefficient $b$, due to internal and air damping as well as the resistance of the tachometer.\n",

The last term in Equation 11 is commonly called the *back emf* developed within the motor (marked as $e_b$ in Figure 6) - it is a reverse voltage proportional to the angular speed of the shaft, and is the reason a DC motor can be used as a generator or tachometer.\n",

The armature current can be varied by introducing additional resistors in series with the winding, and the corresponding motor torque can be measured by an appropriately placed force transducer. The motor torque constant $K_t$ is obtained by plotting the output torque vs. current data. The slope is $K_t$.\n",
